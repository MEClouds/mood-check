# **Burns Depression Checklist React App**

This is a simple React app that calculates your depression level using the Burns Depression Checklist. The Burns Depression Checklist is a self-assessment tool developed by David D. Burns, a cognitive-behavioral therapist and author of "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy." The checklist consists of 20 questions that help you evaluate your symptoms and determine the severity of your depression.

## **How to Use**

Once the app is running, simply answer the 20 questions by selecting the appropriate answer from the dropdown menu.
